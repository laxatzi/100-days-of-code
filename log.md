**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: February 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started to play around with git version control.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 2: February 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following along the bootstrap 4 course by Brad Traversy on Udemy. Completed the first of the five projects.

**Thoughts** I have already built a couple of projects of my own using bootstrap 4. I have also read through documentation for quite a bit. The reason I follow this course is I want to see a seasoned developer in action using the core BS4 features.

### Day 3: February 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following along a second BS4 project tutorial. Building a landing page.

**Thoughts** I started a new Traversy's project called 'mizuxe'. It's a landing page about a book release. I deviate from the tutorial by refraining from using Sass. Sass is something i want to deal with later on. For now i stick to pure CSS.

### Day 4: February 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:Continuing with the project. Added header with hero image/text and  responsiveness to navigation bar.

**Thoughts** I add a header section with hero text/image. Here we show our main message. I like to use height with vh unit instead of px. Made use of the inherit value to decrease repetition.

### Day 5: February 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**:Continuing with the project. Added the Newsletter section.

### Day 6: February 19, Tusday

**Today's Progress**: Added 'About' section with accordion and  'Authors' section with four equal boxes.

### Day  7 : February 21, Thurday

### Day 10: February 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: -Finnished about page. Created equal height boxes with card and css class 'h-100'

**Thoughts**: Really think that boxes in a features section should be equal in height no matter the amount of text content. Lesson make use of jQuery plugins, the ease of use of which I like but I try to build an equelevant function with vanilla

**Link(s) to work**: [Glozzom Theme](https://github.com/laxatzi/glozzomClone/blob/master/blog.html)


### Day 13: February 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read BS4 documentation. Played with sample code and build some components.
                      Read the Introduction to HTTP free book by Launch School.

**Thoughts**: Reading documentation is different than following a tutorial in the sense that the information is overwhelmingly big and detailed (which is a good thing). You delve deeper into the language but at the same time you are at risk of being lost in a maze of utilities and components that are not needed in an average project.


### Day 14: February 28, Thursday

Keep reading the Introduction to HTTP   by Launch School @launchschool

**Today's Progress**:
Spent more time reading the VSCode  documentation. Customized a new color theme. Added a few more snippets. Read the Bootstrap 4 documentation third day. 

**Thoughts**:
I read about the majority of components and utilities without trying to replicate the examples. I just want to get a feel of what is possible with BS4


### Day 17: March 03, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Family obligations today and I hardly managed to code for an hour or so. Read BS4 documentation, mostly about  modals, and popovers.

**Thoughts**:
Taking a break from coding and being more social (physically) and relaxed is a good thing. since recharging batteries, is a gift that we all need to make to ourselves from time to time.


### Day 18:  March 04, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Delved into Bootstrap4 documentation for one more day. Experimented with jquery plugins (modals, popovers and toasts). Created some spinners also.
