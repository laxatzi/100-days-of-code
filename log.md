**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: February 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following along the bootstrap 4 course by Brad Traversy on Udemy. Completed the first of the five projects.

**Thoughts** I have already built a couple of projects of my own using bootstrap 4. I have also read through documentation for quite a bit. The reason I follow this course is I want to see a seasoned developer in action using the core BS4 features.

### Day 2: February 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following along a second BS4 project tutorial. Building a landing page.

**Thoughts** I started a new Traversy's project called 'mizuxe'. It's a landing page about a book release. I deviate from the tutorial by refraining from using Sass. Sass is something i want to deal with later on. For now i stick to pure CSS.

### Day 3: February 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:Continuing with the project. Added header with hero image/text and  responsiveness to navigation bar.

**Thoughts** I add a header section with hero text/image. Here we show our main message. I like to use height with vh unit instead of px. Made use of the inherit value to decrease repetition.
